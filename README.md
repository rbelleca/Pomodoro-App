### App Description
- This is a productivity app that mainly uses the Pomodoro technique, a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, separated by short breaks. Pomodoro app allows its users to create a timer that utilizes the Pomodoro technique to ensure greater productivity. The app recognizes that most people have short attention spans, so one of its goals is to turn that into an advantage. This app allows users to create a schedule, set up timers, and visualize their daily plan up to the smallest details that we don’t usually put in our calendars, like coffee breaks or cool-down time.

### User Stories
  Meet Michael and Toby. Both of them are college students at a 4-year university.
Let me introduce you first to Michael. Michael is very funny guy but he has a problem. He has a habit of procrastinating tasks as he always falls into the trap of using his phone. Michael wants to become a better ‘manager’ of his time and to break his bad habit.

  On the other hand, we have Toby. Nobody likes Toby so he always spends his time studying. He is not doing that well in his classes. Although he always study for extensive hours, Toby loses his focus when he studies and gets really exhausted after. As you can see on his face, that is very much true. He wants to be more efficient and more productive.
   
   Fortunately, there's Pomodoro app to help them get things done. When Michael began using Pomodoro app, he started to plan out week ahead of his tests. Pomodoro made him a couple of study sessions that only lasts for an hour a day until his Calculus test. He was happy because he didn't like to study for extended hours the night before the test like he used to. Now, he feels like he have extra hours in his days to do other things that he loves. 
   
   
### App Features:
 
**QuickTimer™**
- Allows users to set up a timer conveniently as an iPhone timer. However, this feature asks users to input the total amount of hours they would want to study for and how long can they study efficiently, which is basically their focus span. Every person has a different attention span. Some people can study for long extensive hours without getting distracted while others prefer a short study session over a long period of time. 

**Progress Tracker**
- Allows user to keep track of how many hours they have put in. Gives a more in-depth analysis of the users’ progress. Every time QuickTimer or Blueprint is used, users have the option to add it to Progress Tracker. 

**BluePrint™**
- Every student has a big task/event/ test that they want to prepare for like a speech, test, or even a final exam. This feature allows users to add such events and generates a prior schedule of study sessions to ensure that the user is well prepared for the event. The feature helps users break down a big task into smaller ones. The users can choose the recommended time which depends on units taken or they can choose any desired hours.
